            <dd>
                Allows one class to be based on another class, gaining the
                member variables and methods of the inherited class while
                creating new member variables and methods of its own.
                Inheritance allows programmers to define "is-a" relationships
                between classes. For example, a programmer can make an
                <code>Animal</code> class that implements basic animal traits
                and behaviors. Since a dog is an animal, the programmer can
                create a new <code>Dog</code> class that inherits from the
                <code>Animal</code> class (a dog <em>is an</em> animal) and
                gets the traits and behaviors of an animal "for free."

            <dt>Polymorphism</dt>
            <dd>
                Allows a programmer to present the same interface to different
                types of objects (in C++'s case, references and pointers
                <em>to</em> the objects). An example is with the
                <code>Animal</code> and <code>Dog</code> classes. If a function
                <code>pet()</code> expected a reference to an object of type
                <code>Animal</code>, then a reference to an object of type
                <code>Dog</code> could be passed to <code>pet</code> because
                a dog <em>is an</em> animal.

        <p>
            A shallow copy of dynamic data will <em>only</em> copy a pointer to
            dynamically allocated data. If a programmer creates a class that
            dynamically allocates data, then the programmer needs to implement
            a copy constructor so that when a new copy is made the copy
            constructor performs a <em>deep copy</em>. A deep copy is when the
            data in the dynamically allocated memory is copied from the
            original object to the new one. Otherwise, both objects point to
            the same memory address.

            <dt>Compile-time binding</dt>
            <dd>
                Compile-time (or <em>static</em>) binding is the process of
                matching function calls with functions at compile time. This
                can cause unexpected behavior with polymorphism and inherited
                classes overriding inherited methods. If a programmer isn't
                careful, then their programs will behave in unintended ways.
            </dd>
            <dt>Runtime binding</dt>
            <dd>
                Runtime (or <em>dynamic</em>) binding is the process of
                mathcing function calls with functions at runtime. This is
                accomplished by making a function <code>virtual</code>. When
                using dynamic binding, function calls will be matched the
                appropriate functions at runtime. By using <code>virtual</code>
                functions, the compiler knows that functions responsible for
                the functions calls are determined by the type of object that
                is making the call. Using dynamic binding can allow a
                programmer to make full use of polymorphism as now their
                code can call overridden functions in derived classes instead
                of relying on the parent class's functions.
