        <p><strong>How to manipulate data using a structure</strong></p>

        <p>
            Before being used, structures (or, <code>struct</code>s) must be
            declared. This is done in the following example
        </p>

        <pre>
struct Student // structure tag
{
    int studentID;      // structure member
    string name;        // structure member
    short yearInSchool; // structure member
    double gpa;         // structure member
};
        </pre>

        <p>
            The creation of a <code>struct</code> variable of has similar
            semantics to that of primitive data types. And, to access the
            <code>struct</code>'s members we use the dot (<code>.</code>)
            operator. When initializing a struct, you have a couple of options.
            For example
        </p>

        <pre>
// Dot notation
Student stu1;               // similar to int myInt;
stu.studentID = 1234567890;
stu.name = "Billy";
stu.yearInSchool = 1;
stu.gpa = 3.3;

// Array-like notation
Student stu2 = {0987654321, "Johnny", 4, 2.7};

// Partial initialization
Student stu3 = {2358132134, "Amelia", ,};
        </pre>

        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you leave one member uninitialized, you
            must leave all other members that come after it uninitialized as
            well.
        </p>

        <p>Accessing member data is straightforward using the dot notation</p>

        <pre>
cout << stu1.studentID
     << stu1.name
     << stu1.yearInSchool
     << stu1.gpa;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Just like built-in data types, you can make pointers to
            <code>struct</code>s. The creation of pointers to 
            <code>struct</code>s is similar to pointers of any other type, but
            you can access the <code>struct</code>'s members using two different
            methods. As you'll see, one is easier to read than the other.
        </p>

        <pre>
// Dereferencing the pointer
*(stu).name = "Billy";

// Arrow notation
stu->gpa = 3.3;
        </pre>

        <p><strong>How arrays can be used in a structure</strong></p>

        <p>
            <code>struct</code>s' members can include arrays, but you must be
            careful in how you declare them. Member arrays must have their
            length defined in the definition of the <code>struct</code>
            <em>unless</em> it's the last member of the <code>struct</code>
            <a href="#references">[1]</a>.
            For example,
        </p>

        <pre>
// Will compile, flexible length member array declared
// as last member
struct Testing1
{
    int number;
    int numbers[];
};

// Won't compile, member array length not declared
struct Testing2
{
    int numbers[];
    int number;
}

// Will compile, member array length declared
struct Testing3
{
    int numbers[5];
    int number;
};
        </pre>

        <p>To use an array member, you use it just like any other array.</p>

        <pre>
Testing3 testing;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    testing.numbers[i] = i;
}
        </pre>
    </li>

        <p><strong>How to create an array of structures</strong></p>

        <p>
            Arrays of structures can be created quite easily, just like an
            array of built-in data types. Arrays of <code>struct</code>s can
            also be dynamically allocated. For example,
        </p>

        <pre>
const int NUM_STUDENTS = 50;
Student students1[NUM_STUDENTS];

// Dynamically allocate enough space for 50 students
Student *students2 = nullptr;
students2 = new Student[NUM_STUDENTS];
        </pre>

        <p>
            will create two arrays holding enough space for 50
            <code>Student</code> type <code>struct</code>s each.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
