// Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data:
//
// Member Name         | Description
//------------------------------------
// Name                | Idnum
// Tests               | Average
// Grade               | Student name
// Student ID number   | Pointer to an array of test scores
// Average test score  | Course grade
//
// The program should keep a list of test scores for a group of students. It
// should ask the user how many test scores there are to be and how many
// students there are. It should then dynamically allocate an array of
// structures. Each structure’s Tests member should point to a dynamically
// allocated array that will hold the test scores.

// After the arrays have been dynamically allocated, the program should ask for
// the ID number and all the test scores for each student. The average test
// score should be calculated and stored in the average member of each
// structure. The course grade should be computed on the basis of the following
// grading scale:
//
// Average Test Grage | Course Grade
//------------------------------------
// 91-100             | A
// 81-90              | B
// 71-80              | C
// 61-70              | D
// 60 or below        | F
//
// The course grade should then be stored in the Grade member of each
// structure. Once all this data is calculated, a table should be displayed
// on the screen listing each student’s name, ID number, average test score,
// and course grade.

// Input Validation: Be sure all the data for each student is entered. Do not
// accept negative numbers for any test score.
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Structure for holding information about a student

{
    string name;            // Student name
    unsigned int idNum;     // Student ID number
    double* tests;          // Pointer to an array of test scores
    double average;         // Average test score
    char grade;             // Course grade
};
