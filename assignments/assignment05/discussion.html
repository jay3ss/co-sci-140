        1. Explain operator overloading; be succinct and to the point. 
    -->
    <li>
        <p>
            Operator overloading allows you to use an operator to manipulate
            class data in an easy, intuitive manner using C++ operators. For
            example, if you have a <code>Date</code> class that models dates,
            then instead of creating a member function called <code>add</code>
            you can overload the <code>+</code> and <code>=</code> operators
            to make adding two dates as straightforward as primitive data
            types. So, instead of doing
        </p>

        <pre>
today.add(1);   // now today is tomorrow's date
        </pre>

        <p>
            you can do
        </p>

        <pre>
tomorrow = today + 1;   // now tomorrow is tomorrow's date
        </pre>

        <p>
            which is much more straightforward and intuitive than the first
            example. To overload an operator, use the following syntax
        </p>

        <pre>
// Date is the return type
// operator= is the operator that is being overloaded
// const Date &right is the parameter
Date operator= (const Date &right);
        </pre>

        <p>
            You can also overload the relational operators as well to make
            comparison of objects easy and intuitive. Continuing with the
            <code>Date</code> class example, if we want to compare two
            <code>Date</code> instances we'd either have to create member
            functions that do the comparison or directly compare the member
            attribute data directly. Either way results in a clunky interface
            for the programmer. If we overload relational operators then the
            interface for the programmer is, again, easier and intuitive. For
            example, if we were to overload the <code><</code> operator we
            can compare two <code>Date</code> instances like the following
            example
        </p>

        <pre>
// today is today's date & tomorrow is tomorrow's date
if (today < tomorrow)
{
    cout << "Today is before tomorrow";
}
else
{
    cout << "Tomorrow is before today";
}
// the result of the above block of code is:
// Today is before tomorrow
        </pre>

        <p>
            The syntax for overloading the relational operators is the same
            syntax as above.
        </p>

        2. Explain and use static members of a class; be succinct and to the point.  
    -->
    <li>
        <p>
            Class member variables declared as <code>static</code> are
            accessible to <em>all</em> instances of that class. No matter how
            many instances of a class there are, there will only be one copy
            of <code>static</code> member variables. You must remember to have
            a declaration of the <code>static</code> member variable that's
            <em>outside</em> of the class in order for it to be created in
            memory. An example of this is counting the number of instances of a
            class. For example,
        </p>

        <pre>
// MyClass.h
class MyClass
{
private:
    static int numObjects;
public:
    MyClass()
    { numObjects++; }

    int getNumObjects() const
    { return numObjects; }
};

// Define in global scope of program
int MyClass::numObjects = 0;

// In main function of program
MyClass myClass1;
MyClass myClass2;

// Both calls to getNumObjects will result in 2
cout << "Number of objects of type MyClass: " 
     << myClass1.getNumObjects();

cout << "Number of objects of type MyClass: " 
     << myClass2.getNumObjects();
        </pre>

        <p>
            Class member functions declared as <code>static</code> can be
            called <em>before</em> any instances of the class are instantiated.
            and can only operate on <code>static</code> member variables. When
            using a <code>static</code> member function, make sure to use the
            scope resolution operator (<code>::</code>) instead of the dot
            operator. Also note that the class name is used instead of an
            instance when calling the function as well. The above example can
            be modified to use a
            <code>static</code> member function instead of a variable.
        </p>

<pre>
// MyClass.h
class MyClass
{
private:
    static int numObjects;
public:
    MyClass()
    { numObjects++; }

    static int getNumObjects()
    { return numObjects; }
};

// Define in global scope of program
int MyClass::numObjects = 0;

// In main function of program

cout << "Number of objects of type MyClass: "
     << MyClass::getNumObjects();
// The output of the cout statement above is
// Number of objects of type MyClass: 0

// Instantiate two MyClass objects
MyClass myClass1;
MyClass myClass2;

cout << "Number of objects of type MyClass: " 
     << MyClass::getNumObjects();
// The output of the cout statement above is
// Number of objects of type MyClass: 2
        </pre>

           succinct and to the point. 
    -->
    <li>
        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt>member function of a class</dt>
                <dd>
                    A member of the class and has full access to all variables
                    within that class (unless declared <code>static</code>). A
                    member function is declared with the following syntax:

                    <pre>
// {return type} {class name::function name}({parameters});
void MyClass::myMemberFunction(int n);
                    </pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>friend of a class</dt>
                <dd>
                    A friend of a class is a function that is not a member of
                    the class, but has access to the private members of the
                    class. A function is declared as a friend of a class with
                    the following syntax:

                    <pre>
// friend {return type} {class name::function name}({parameters});
friend void MyClass::myFriendFunction(int n);
                    </pre>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </p>
