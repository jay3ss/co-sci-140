// Write a program that scores the following data about a soccer player in a
// structure:
//
//     Player’s Name
//     Player’s Number
//     Points Scored by Player
//
// The program should keep an array of 12 of these structures. Each element is
// for a different player on a team. When the program runs, it should ask the
// user to enter the data for each player. It should then show a table that
// lists each player’s number, name, and points scored. The program should also
// calculate and display the total points earned by the team. The number and
// name of the player who has earned the most points should also be displayed.
//
// Input Validation: Do no accept negative values for players’ numbers or points scored.
